You’re building a tiny HTML wrapper / SDK that developers can drop into any webpage:

<script src="https://cdn.adaptive-identity.ai/identity.js"></script>
<div data-identity-component="hero" data-variants="3">
   Original content
</div>As soon as this loads:

      1️⃣ Event Tracking (Behavioral Analytics Layer)

      Your client SDK automatically tracks:
      	•	component viewed
      	•	time on component
      	•	clicks
      	•	scroll depth
      	•	page viewed

      It sends these events to your backend (MongoDB).

      2️⃣ Multi-Agent Variant Selection (AI Personalization)

      Your backend has AI “agents” working together:
      	•	Pattern detector
      	•	Conversion predictor
      	•	Variant generator
      	•	Identity classifier (user persona modelling)

      These agents:
      	•	Analyze the user’s behavior
      	•	Look at historical performance
      	•	Decide which variant gives the highest chance of conversion for this user
3️⃣ SDK Rewrites the UI Dynamically

Your JS engine reads that response and updates the DOM:
	•	Replace hero text
	•	Replace button CTA
	•	Add urgency styling
	•	Swap images (optional)

4️⃣ Loop Continues → Self-Improving Product

Users interact further → events flow back → AI agents improve → variant becomes smarter.

🎯 Theme Fit: IDENTITY

This is PERFECT for the theme:
🧩 Amplitude Challenge Fit

Amplitude wants:
✔ behavioral events
✔ AI that uses those events
✔ system that changes UI based on data
✔ product that gets smarter continuously
